        <h2>Values vs. Stereotype Threat</h2>
        <h4>12.10.2014</h4>
        <p>This week we were prompted to take a look at our values. DBC gave us a list of values and asked us to find values that described moments when we were happiest or most proud. The following values compose my fondest, most memorable moments:<p>
        <ul>
          <li>Accomplishment</li>
          <li>Close Relationships</li>
          <li>Inspiration</li>
          <li>Serenity</li>
          <li>Independence</li>
          <li>Self-Reliance</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In the exercise, we were then asked from a scale of 1-5, if we try to live up to these values.</p>
        <h1>Disagree 1 ----- 2 ----- 3 ----- 4 ----- 5 Agree</h1>

        <p>For most of these values, I believe I am at a 4 or a 5 in how much I try to live up to the selected values. Independence, for me, is a huge one. I value being resourceful and I find that I am happiest when I can figure something out on my own. For me, there is a direct correlation between independence and a sense of accomplishment. One of my happiest moments was backpacking around Europe on my own. I remember sitting on the dock, overlooking the water, and feeling very proud of myself for braving it solo. This feeling has always stuck with me, instilled self-confidence, and made me better prepared for future obstacles.</p>

        <p>The last time someone came to me for advice was when my sister was experiencing self-doubt. She was about to take the MCAT for medical school and had major anxiety over whether she should cancel the test date. When she talked to me about it, she felt she had prepared enough but then she started talking to other students and comparing herself to them. By comparison, she felt unsure of her abilities and because of this, wanted to reschedule it for later. After witnessing my sister prepare for many months for the MCAT, I knew that the fears she had were unfounded and were directly correlated to talking to others. By talking this over with her and reassuring her of her abilities, she did decide to go through with it.</p>

        <p>When I reflect on my own values and the advice I gave to my sister, I see ways in which to combat stereotype threat at DBC. Hearing someone else out and allowing him or her to express anxiety is an effective method in allaying doubts. Providing assurance of one's self-worth is also key in encouraging another to keep going and not give up. The growth mindset is also crucial for self-development. Even (or rather, especially) when times are difficult, there is room to stretch and become even better. I think these two methods will be helpful in being supportive of others at DBC. We are taking on something incredibly difficult together and it's important to be mindful of any stereotype threat that may arise.</p>
