        <h2>The New Rehab: Mindfulness in Tech</h2>
        <h4>11.23.2014</h4>
        <p>The tech industry is a bustling, happening place. Gadgets and ideas are aplenty in this field of innovation, with e-mails being shot off and replied to at a fiery speed. At any hour of the day, you can plug into the Internet and find a boundless world of information and interaction. With the bounty that tech provides, it is easy to get caught up in it. This is simultaneously an exciting prospect and a terrifying one.
        </p>

        <p>Being constantly plugged in has its repercussions. How many times have you found yourself in public checking your e-mail or new feed? Was it absolutely necessary? The answer, more often than not, is no. I am equaly guilty of this and find that my ability to respond to e-mails in ten minute windows pays the price of not being present. I've missed opportunities to observe and enjoy moments, too engrossed with what's on my screen. With this, also comes a tech-specific anxiety to stay occupied.
        </p>
        <p>Now, before you dismiss this as a hippy-dippy post on the latest trend (I'm with you on gluten-free eating, juicing and mud-runs), hear me out:

        </div>
        <p>Here we have a graph courtesy of Google Trends. There has been a significant rise in people searching for "digital detox." A term that came to fruition in 2012, this graph is evidence of people looking for a remedy.
        </p>
        <p>
        Unsurprisingly, the regional interest lies in one state in particular, which houses one of the biggest tech hubs:

            <p>Data Source: Google Trends (www.google.com/trends).</p>
        </div>
        <p>
        Simply put, people are searching for a way to get lives back, gadget-free. This <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/alltechconsidered/2013/07/05/198402213/at-tech-free-camps-people-pay-hundreds-to-unplug">NPR Article</a> references <a href= "http://campgrounded.org/">Camp Grounded</a>, a camp marketed to overworked, over-plugged adults. Goers have the opportunity to experience meaningful conversation without the constant presence of electronic devices. The NPR article even references a goer remarking that he felt "phantom rings" while at camp.
        </p>
        <p>
        I advise you to take this post with a grain of salt. Like most things, it's best to practice moderation. Technology has benefitted us greatly and improved our standard of living. I will not be giving my laptop away or swearing off my smart phone any time soon. With that said though, it's important to be mindful of our usage. If you find yourself pondering the term "digital detox", considering silencing your phone and taking a walk in the great outdoors.
