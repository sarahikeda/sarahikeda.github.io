## Phase 0, Week 5

In the programming world, pair programming is a common occurrence. It's the opportunity to work with another person, collaborating on code. How a session is run greatly depends on the pair's preference, but usually involves one person driving (typing) and another navigating (directing the driver). Another way to pair is called ping pong pairing, which involves two people simultaneously working on the code with one writing the test and the other writing code to pass the other's test.

In the last five weeks of DBC, I've had the opportunity to pair with many people in my cohort on challenges. While initially nervous to expose my novice knowledge to others, I now find myself eager to jump right in with pairing challenges. I think this is greatly attributed to the openness, willingness and curiosity of my fellow DBC students. Being able to work on something together provides instant feedback and encouragement.

It's been interesting to see different people's thinking styles and discover the best way to work together. The biggest thing I've learned for a successful pairing session, is to have open communication. It's important to check in with your pair, discuss strategy and make sure both people are comfortable. It's also been crucial to talk through obstacles and one's thought process. Admittedly, for me, this is not always easy. I like to think on my own when tackling problems but pair programming has made me realize that my partner is also an asset and can be key in pointing out something or making suggestions.

With each pairing session, through the handy DBC tool, "Feedbackinator", I've given and received feedback from my partner. When I first heard about this, it reminded me of the days of AOL Instant Messenger. In middle school, I remember someone in my school sent out a survey that could be filled out anonymously, to rate an individual on looks, intelligence and popularity. Thankfully the survey only made it to a couple people, but I do remember it creating drama because anonymous feedback led to some not-nice comments. On the contrary, though, Feedbackinator has been an ego-boosting, positive tool. I've learned from comments that I can be my worst critic because I'll think I didn't contribute enough, even though the feedback from my partner will say the contrary. Getting feedback like this is encouraging and also reinforces the importance of pair programming best practices (communication, communication, communication)!
