# Phase 0, Week 2

I'm a sucker for personality tests. I remember spending a large amount of time (too much) in middle school taking quiz after quiz, from chain e-mails to magazines. The draw for me has always been the value in reading the results. Each test, no matter the topic ("What does your favorite candy say about you?", "What age do you actually act?") provided a little more insight into myself so I could reflect and improve.

At the beginning of Dev Bootcamp we were asked to take a test on our thinking styles.Enthusiastically, I answered the questions, picking the most-fitting words from a set of attributes. Was I precise? Systematic? A people person?

The results of the test indicated that I am an: Abstract Random Thinker

My first though, upon reading this, was, "Oh crap." That doesn't sound like an ideal computer programmer! That means I'm not an orderly, sequential thinker. That means I'm all over the place! After taking another second to recover and reflect, I realized that being an abstract random thinker can also be an advantage.

Abstract thinkers flourish when they are able to brainstorm ideas and using their intuition, beyond what is actually on the surface. As an abstract random thinker, I enjoy listening to others and participating in group activities.

Looking back on the past couple weeks of DBC (I can't believe it's the end of week 3 already!), I have certainly gotten to know myself better and seen some of these qualities come into play. I've really enjoyed the practice of pair programming for the opportunity to collaborate with others and discuss our ideas ahead of time. Working on one challenge at a time, has also required me to focus on one thing at a time, which is pinpointed as a potential weakness for abstract random.

DBC also introduced the concept of a fixed mindset vs. growth mindset, which I found useful while learning programming (especially at such a rapid pace). The growth mindset emphasizes that one's ability is not limited and one can work on becoming better and stronger. Reflecting back on my abstract random thinking through this growth mindset, I am aware that I can play up my strengths while simultaneously improving upon my weaknesses.

All in all, the test was a fun throwback to my quiz-taking days and I found value in the results. I have a feeling that I'll be coming out of DBC not just with programming skills, but with greater understanding of myself as a whole. Bring it on!
