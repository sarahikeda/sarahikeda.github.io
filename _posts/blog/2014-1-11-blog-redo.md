## Phase 0, Week 9

And so marks the last week of Phase 0. I still feel like I'm in a dream world, amongst other DBC cohort members (now turned roommates), with DBC onsite around the corner (eek, tomorrow!).

For our final exercise, we were prompted to revamp our blog. For those of you who caught a glimpse of my past blog, you probably saw a multitude of inconsistencies in where certain elements were positioned on the site. To rise to the occasion and eliminate this issue, I chose to take on Jekyll. The fun part was choosing a theme. A search feature? Sign me up! The creation of a button without formatting the CSS myself? Let's do it.

Jekyll proved to be a little more than met the eye. After selecting a theme and making changes, I found myself with a steep learning curve to understand its quirks. This did not come without repercussions. I lost my work several times by using the _site directory, which is a temporary folder, not meant to store changes. Thankfully, with the help of my cohort roommates and lots of gumption, the site is up and running! Here's to a new outlook (in every sense).
