## Phase 0, Week 1


To cap off the first week, Shereef Bishay, founder of DBC, held a fireside chat about the program. I found myself wow-ed by Shereef's humility and came away from the talk with enough quotes to plaster my bedroom walls and refrigerator with.

Shereef introduced the concept of Kitchen Vs. Restaurant. You see, most of us slip into the habit of being the consumer. When you go to a restaurant you peruse the menu, select the most desirable item, and then wait to be served. Perhaps you'll complain amount the amount of the time the dish takes to be prepared or have buyer's envy when you see a neighboring diner eating a hearty steak while you're pushing around salad leaves. The thing is, you're in a passive role, waiting for things to happen to you.

In contrast, students who attend DBC are encouraged to join the kitchen. Get out your chef's hat! Sharpen the knives! Start seasoning the soup (ok, you get it)! Basically, it's a "Hey, take charge of your learning. Be the one creating."With joining the kitchen ranks, students will then take owernship and invest in their own learning.

Alongside this key metaphor, is the encouragement to "expose your ignorance." This makes me nervous but I am going to rise to the challenge. As a longtime practitioner of the fixed mindset, I shy away from this because frankly, I don't want to appear unintelligent. What happens if everyone else is taking the new information in stride while I struggle with it?

When it comes down to it, I am responsible for taking note of what I do not understand and voicing this issue when it comes up. Being vulnerable and adapting to the growth mindset of embracing struggle, will pay off, not just at DBC, but in all aspects of life.

Much like a fitness bootcamp instructor (without all the yelling and pushups, thank god), Shereef's talk was an empowering one. I'm grateful to be a part of DBC and am excited to keep pushing myself to be the best developer possible. The most important thing is to keep embracing the challenges wholeheartedly, even when the going gets tough.
