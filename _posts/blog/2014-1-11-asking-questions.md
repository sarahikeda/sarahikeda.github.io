## Phase 0, Week 9

As a beginning developer, asking questions is a common occurrence. And, more importantly, it's a necessary one. When pairing with another person, it's important to keep aligned in train-of-thought, in order to have an effective session. If one person stays quiet and doesn't let on when he or she doesnâ€™t understand something, it can lead to more confusion down the line. It also prevents the session from being a true collaboration because both people are not actively sharing their ideas. So, in noting the significance of asking questions and voicing confusion, how does one ask a good question?

Be specific. In order for someone else to understand your question, try and be as detailed as possible in what you need help with. In a programming context, what language are you working with? What are some of the keywords? I've found that learning programming has helped me to hone my Google search skill. In order to find an answer, I will make sure to specify what it is Iâ€™m trying to do and in what context. For example, if I'm trying to change a header to something specific in CSS I will make sure to include the element, the language, and what specific property I want to modify.

Listen to other people's questions. Be receptive. In order to ask good questions, you need to be a good listener. Hearing what other people have to say is a crucial part in being able to formulate your own questions. Pay attention to how they ask the questions and when they do.

Be open. As stated before, make sure to be open to asking questions and receiving answers. With this attitude, you can accelerate your learning process and make it easier on yourself.
