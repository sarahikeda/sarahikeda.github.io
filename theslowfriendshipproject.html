      <h4>ABOUT</h4>
      <p>NYC can be lonely. We've found it hard to meet people through the flurry of social apps out there and want to provide another way.</p></br>
      <p>The Slow Friendship Project is about taking a breather -- slowing down to have conversations with people we might not normally meet in our daily rush.</p>

          <textarea class="form-control"rows="5" placeholder="Before you attend the event, please submit something personal about you -- an anecdote, fun fact, whatever you feel comfortable with!"></textarea>

      <p>These will be anonymized and we'll each take turns reading one at random and then responding with our own story (Reasoning: We're testing out a hypothesis that people want to share things that are vulnerable but want to do so in a comfortable space where what they share is reciprocated in some way).</p>

      <h4>WHAT TO EXPECT</h4>
      <p>Think low key. Sarah will host a small group of 4-6 people in her apartment (it's small but cozy) and we'll have a potluck on Sunday evening.</p>
