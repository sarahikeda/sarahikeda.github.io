        <p>So much of the burden of societal integration is put on refugees. I want to shift the onus of refugee integration onto the people who are already assimilated.</p>

        <p>To make this effective, I feel that people need to empathize with what refugees are going through. By putting themselves in the shoes of others, they are then able to better relate to others and foster  connection.</p>

        <p>My approach at building empathy stems from Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs. Some of the very basic of needs are taken away from reugees -- shelter, security, stability. How do you make someone else feel this void?</p>

        <p>With OneUs, the user listens to a series of prompts. They are walked through scenarios in which they, one by one, are stripped away of their basic needs. I was drawn to the meditative, still idea of this emulation because I think it's important to stop and reflect, rather than the default of constant motion.</p>

        <p>After guided through this meditation, the user is given options to reach out and create connection. Rather than a tangible object approach, a user is asked to donate "needs." They are given the opportunity to invite a refugee into their home to share a meal (physiological need), attend a faciliated conversation (understanding, belonging) or invite someone to stay with them (shelter).</p>
