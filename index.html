        <p>I am a writer turned web developer. I spent a bulk of my career writing about other people doing things and realised I wanted to be the one who was creating. I attended Dev Bootcamp to accomplish this, learning new skill sets that have enabled me to build my own visions.</p>

<p>I've had the fortune of traveling to many countries and this has instilled a great appreciation for other cultures. As a developer, this appreciation has and will continue to shape my drive to create something meaningful, which connects people and communities.
