          <p>I am a writer turned <span style="font-weight: bold">web developer</span>. I spent a bulk of my career writing about other people doing things but realized something was missing -- I wanted to be the one who was <span style="font-weight: bold">creating</span>. I attended Dev Bootcamp to accomplish this, learning new skill sets that have enabled me to build my own visions.</p>

          <p>Learning a new subject online can be an exciting journey, but you shouldn't have to do it alone. Our app tackles this problem by bringing students from sites like Khan Academy together based on location. Students can find meet-ups for courses near their location, chat with other peers and seek help in the forum. InSession was built with Ruby on Rails, Postgres, Elastic Search, Faye, Mapbox and CoffeeScript.</p>
