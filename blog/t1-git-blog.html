          <p>First week is a wrap! The week's primary focus at Dev Bootcamp (DBC) was getting over the Git hump. I'm not sure how DBC did it (and perhaps it was the repeated exposure to Git articles), but it's finally clicking. I'm glad that Git is no longer the scary tool experienced developers explain as "Super confusing. But no worries, one day you'll get it." With a nod to DBC's suggestion of starting small to build bigger things (and gain greater understanding), I have eased myself into using Git and am ready to take on more complexities in the future.</p>

          <p>So let's break it down. What is Git exactly?</p>

          <p>Well, for one, it's a software. Git's usefulness is in something called version control. Every time you make changes to a project, Git will serve as a record of sorts, keeping track of what revisions were made and saving the original version (creating snapshots). GitHub is the website used to store these repositories (files). In the programming world it's common practice to have multiple people working together on a project. For this, Git and GitHub are a godsend. Team members can work on a project simultaneously and both save changes. Without Git, this could be a tricky situation, since one person's work could overwrite the other's. With Git, the changes are magically merged together (well, not complete magic, as you have to command it to), and saved.</p>

          <p>GitHub also is a helpful tool for its accessibility. Team members can have immediate access to the most recent update of a project and start working on it without delay.</p>

          <p>Helpful commands to keep in mind:
          git status - check the status of your changes. Are they committed? Untracked? Find out!<br>

          git add .  OR  git add file<br>

          git commit -m "commit message"   -- be specific with the message</p>
