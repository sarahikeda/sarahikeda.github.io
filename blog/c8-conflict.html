        <h2>Conflict No More</h2>
        <h4>01.02.2014</h4>
        <p>While working at my last company, we underwent a management change. This change consisted of intensive training, the lowering of cubicle walls and workshops on conflict resolution. With the latter, there was a focus on the root cause of problems. More often than not, when dealing with conflict, there is an underlying issue, which can be uncovered upon analysis.</p>

        <p>Take for example, the ever-so-common mother/daughter fight. Over the holidays, my mother and I had a long, drawn out fight. My mother often gives my sister and I material gifts. While very much appreciated, I often see these gifts as excessive, as they are not things I need or necessarily will wear (Disclaimer: I fully recognize that this is a very privileged conflict to have). Because of this, rather than having my mother waste her money, I will often thank her for the gift but ask if she can return it to get her money back. This upsets my mother because she wants me to use the item. Upon further examination of the conflict, I can recognize that my mother uses these gifts as tokens of affection. It is her way of expressing that she cares about her children and that she still wants to provide for them. When I reject the items, she sees this by extension, as a rejection of herself. The callousness in which I dealt with the situation hurt her, as I didn't see the emotions that were tied towards the act of giving.</p>

        <p>In order to properly analyze and resolve this conflict, I talked to my mother after we took time to cool down from the situation. This enabled us to talk about it calmly to get to the root of the matter. By talking to my mother and listening to where she was coming from, we were able to reach a resolution. She understood my actions better and we came to a compromise, where we could both express how much we cared about each other in other, non-material ways.</p>

        <p>I learned that people have emotions that are not necessarily expressed in their verbal communication, which is why their reactions can seem unnecessarily amplified. In this case, I did not realize how much the act of giving and receiving meant to my mother. By examining underlying motives and talking through a situation, it is possible to resolve conflict.</p>
